  abstract = {This thesis is about mathematical optimization for the efficient use of railway infrastructure. We address the  optimal allocation of the available railway track capacity - the track allocation problem. This track allocation problem is a major challenge for a railway company, independent of  whether a free market, a private monopoly, or a public monopoly is given. Planning and operating railway transportation systems is extremely hard due  to the combinatorial complexity of the underlying discrete optimization problems,  the technical intricacies, and the immense sizes of the problem instances. Mathematical models and optimization techniques can result in huge gains for both railway customers and operators, e.g.,  in terms of cost reductions or service quality improvements.  We tackle this challenge by developing novel mathematical models and associated innovative algorithmic  solution methods for large scale instances. This allows us to produce for the first time reliable  solutions for a real world instance, i.e., the Simplon corridor in Switzerland. The opening chapter gives a comprehensive overview on railway planning problems. This provides insights into the regulatory and technical framework,  it discusses the interaction of several planning steps, and identifies optimization potentials in  railway transportation. The remainder of the thesis is comprised of two major parts.  The first part is concerned with modeling railway systems to allow for resource and capacity analysis. Railway capacity has basically two dimensions, a space dimension which are the physical  infrastructure elements as well as a time dimension that refers to the train movements, i.e.,  occupation or blocking times, on the physical infrastructure. Railway safety systems operate  on the same principle all over the world. A train has to reserve infrastructure blocks for some time to pass through.  Two trains reserving the same block of the infrastructure within the same point in time is called block conflict.   Therefore, models for railway capacity involve the definition  and calculation of reasonable running and associated reservation and  blocking times to allow for a conflict free allocation. In the second and main part of the thesis, the optimal track  allocation problem for macroscopic models of the railway system is considered. The literature for related problems is surveyed.  A graph-theoretic model for the track allocation problem is  developed. In that model optimal track allocations correspond to  conflict-free paths in special time-expanded graphs. Furthermore, we made considerable progress on solving track allocation problems by two  main features - a novel modeling approach for the macroscopic track  allocation problem and algorithmic improvements based on the utilization of the bundle method.    Finally, we go back to practice and present in the last chapter several case  studies using the tools netcast and tsopt. We provide a computational comparison of  our new models and standard packing models used in the literature.  Our computational experience indicates that our approach, i.e., ``configuration models'', outperforms other models. Moreover, the rapid branching  heuristic and the bundle method enable us to produce high quality solutions for very large scale instances, which has not been possible before.  In addition, we present results for a theoretical and rather visionary auction framework  for track allocation. We discuss several auction design questions and analyze experiments of  various auction simulations.  The highlights are results for the Simplon corridor in Switzerland.  We optimized the train traffic through this tunnel using our models and  software tools. To the best knowledge of the author and confirmed by several railway  practitioners this was the first time that fully automatically produced  track allocations on a macroscopic scale fulfill the requirements  of the originating microscopic model, withstand the evaluation in the  microscopic simulation tool OpenTrack, and exploit the infrastructure capacity. This documents the success of our approach in practice and the usefulness  and applicability of mathematical optimization to railway track allocation.},

  abstract = {This thesis investigates the frontier between machine learning and combinatorial optimization, two active areas of applied mathematics research. We combine theoretical insights with efficient algorithms, and develop several open source Julia libraries. Inspired by a collaboration with the Société nationale des chemins de fer français (SNCF), we study high-impact use cases from the railway world: train failure prediction, delay propagation, and track allocation. In Part I, we provide mathematical background and describe software implementations for various tools that will be needed later on: implicit differentiation, temporal point processes, Hidden Markov Models and Multi-Agent Path Finding. Our publicly available code fills a void in the Julia package ecosystem, aiming at ease of use without compromising on performance. In Part II, we highlight theoretical contributions related to both statistics and decision-making. We consider a Vector AutoRegressive process with partial observations, and prove matching upper and lower bounds on the estimation error. We unify and extend the state of the art for combinatorial optimization layers in deep learning, gathering various approaches in a Julia library called InferOpt.jl. We also seek to differentiate through multi-objective optimization layers, which leads to a novel theory of lexicographic convex analysis. In Part III, these mathematical and algorithmic foundations come together to tackle railway problems. We design a hierarchical model of train failures, propose a graph-based framework for delay propagation, and suggest new avenues for track allocation, with the Flatland challenge as a testing ground.},
