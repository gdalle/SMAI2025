  abstract    = {This thesis is about mathematical optimization for the efficient use of railway infrastructure. We address the  optimal allocation of the available railway track capacity - the track allocation problem. This track allocation problem is a major challenge for a railway company, independent of  whether a free market, a private monopoly, or a public monopoly is given. Planning and operating railway transportation systems is extremely hard due  to the combinatorial complexity of the underlying discrete optimization problems,  the technical intricacies, and the immense sizes of the problem instances. Mathematical models and optimization techniques can result in huge gains for both railway customers and operators, e.g.,  in terms of cost reductions or service quality improvements.  We tackle this challenge by developing novel mathematical models and associated innovative algorithmic  solution methods for large scale instances. This allows us to produce for the first time reliable  solutions for a real world instance, i.e., the Simplon corridor in Switzerland. The opening chapter gives a comprehensive overview on railway planning problems. This provides insights into the regulatory and technical framework,  it discusses the interaction of several planning steps, and identifies optimization potentials in  railway transportation. The remainder of the thesis is comprised of two major parts.  The first part is concerned with modeling railway systems to allow for resource and capacity analysis. Railway capacity has basically two dimensions, a space dimension which are the physical  infrastructure elements as well as a time dimension that refers to the train movements, i.e.,  occupation or blocking times, on the physical infrastructure. Railway safety systems operate  on the same principle all over the world. A train has to reserve infrastructure blocks for some time to pass through.  Two trains reserving the same block of the infrastructure within the same point in time is called block conflict.   Therefore, models for railway capacity involve the definition  and calculation of reasonable running and associated reservation and  blocking times to allow for a conflict free allocation. In the second and main part of the thesis, the optimal track  allocation problem for macroscopic models of the railway system is considered. The literature for related problems is surveyed.  A graph-theoretic model for the track allocation problem is  developed. In that model optimal track allocations correspond to  conflict-free paths in special time-expanded graphs. Furthermore, we made considerable progress on solving track allocation problems by two  main features - a novel modeling approach for the macroscopic track  allocation problem and algorithmic improvements based on the utilization of the bundle method.    Finally, we go back to practice and present in the last chapter several case  studies using the tools netcast and tsopt. We provide a computational comparison of  our new models and standard packing models used in the literature.  Our computational experience indicates that our approach, i.e., ``configuration models'', outperforms other models. Moreover, the rapid branching  heuristic and the bundle method enable us to produce high quality solutions for very large scale instances, which has not been possible before.  In addition, we present results for a theoretical and rather visionary auction framework  for track allocation. We discuss several auction design questions and analyze experiments of  various auction simulations.  The highlights are results for the Simplon corridor in Switzerland.  We optimized the train traffic through this tunnel using our models and  software tools. To the best knowledge of the author and confirmed by several railway  practitioners this was the first time that fully automatically produced  track allocations on a macroscopic scale fulfill the requirements  of the originating microscopic model, withstand the evaluation in the  microscopic simulation tool OpenTrack, and exploit the infrastructure capacity. This documents the success of our approach in practice and the usefulness  and applicability of mathematical optimization to railway track allocation.},

  abstract    = {This thesis investigates the frontier between machine learning and combinatorial optimization, two active areas of applied mathematics research. We combine theoretical insights with efficient algorithms, and develop several open source Julia libraries. Inspired by a collaboration with the Société nationale des chemins de fer français (SNCF), we study high-impact use cases from the railway world: train failure prediction, delay propagation, and track allocation. In Part I, we provide mathematical background and describe software implementations for various tools that will be needed later on: implicit differentiation, temporal point processes, Hidden Markov Models and Multi-Agent Path Finding. Our publicly available code fills a void in the Julia package ecosystem, aiming at ease of use without compromising on performance. In Part II, we highlight theoretical contributions related to both statistics and decision-making. We consider a Vector AutoRegressive process with partial observations, and prove matching upper and lower bounds on the estimation error. We unify and extend the state of the art for combinatorial optimization layers in deep learning, gathering various approaches in a Julia library called InferOpt.jl. We also seek to differentiate through multi-objective optimization layers, which leads to a novel theory of lexicographic convex analysis. In Part III, these mathematical and algorithmic foundations come together to tackle railway problems. We design a hierarchical model of train failures, propose a graph-based framework for delay propagation, and suggest new avenues for track allocation, with the Flatland challenge as a testing ground.},

  abstract   = {The Flatland competition aimed at finding novel approaches to solve the vehicle re-scheduling problem (VRSP). The VRSP is concerned with scheduling trips in traffic networks and the re-scheduling of vehicles when disruptions occur, for example the breakdown of a vehicle. While solving the VRSP in various settings has been an active area in operations research (OR) for decades, the ever-growing complexity of modern railway networks makes dynamic real-time scheduling of traffic virtually impossible. Recently, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has successfully tackled challenging tasks where many agents need to be coordinated, such as multiplayer video games. However, the coordination of hundreds of agents in a real-life setting like a railway network remains challenging and the Flatland environment used for the competition models these real-world properties in a simplified manner. Submissions had to bring as many trains (agents) to their target stations in as little time as possible. While the best submissions were in the OR category, participants found many promising MARL approaches. Using both centralized and decentralized learning based approaches, top submissions used graph representations of the environment to construct tree-based observations. Further, different coordination mechanisms were implemented, such as communication and prioritization between agents. This paper presents the competition setup, four outstanding solutions to the competition, and a cross-comparison between them.},

It is widely employed as a canonical model to study clustering and community detection, and provides generally a fertile ground to study the statistical and computational tradeoffs that arise in network and data sciences. This note surveys the recent developments that establish the fundamental limits for community detection in the SBM, both with respect to information-theoretic and computational thresholds, and for various recovery requirements such as exact, partial and weak recovery (a.k.a., detection). The main results discussed are the phase transitions for exact recovery at the Chernoff-Hellinger threshold, the phase transition for weak recovery at the Kesten- Stigum threshold, the optimal distortion-SNR tradeoff for partial recovery, the learning of the SBM parameters and the gap between information-theoretic and computational thresholds. The note also covers some of the algorithms developed in the quest of achieving the limits, in particular two-round algorithms via graph-splitting, semi-definite programming, linearized belief propagation, classical and nonbacktracking spectral methods. A few open problems are also discussed.},

  abstract   = {Efficient automated scheduling of trains remains a major challenge for modern railway systems. The underlying vehicle rescheduling problem (VRSP) has been a major focus of Operations Research (OR) since decades. Traditional approaches use complex simulators to study VRSP, where experimenting with a broad range of novel ideas is time consuming and has a huge computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce a two-dimensional simplified grid environment called "Flatland" that allows for faster experimentation. Flatland does not only reduce the complexity of the full physical simulation, but also provides an easy-to-use interface to test novel approaches for the VRSP, such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Imitation Learning (IL). In order to probe the potential of Machine Learning (ML) research on Flatland, we (1) ran a first series of RL and IL experiments and (2) design and executed a public Benchmark at NeurIPS 2020 to engage a large community of researchers to work on this problem. Our own experimental results, on the one hand, demonstrate that ML has potential in solving the VRSP on Flatland. On the other hand, we identify key topics that need further research. Overall, the Flatland environment has proven to be a robust and valuable framework to investigate the VRSP for railway networks. Our experiments provide a good starting point for further research and for the participants of the NeurIPS 2020 Flatland Benchmark. All of these efforts together have the potential to have a substantial impact on shaping the mobility of the future.},

Due to its numerous practical applications of multi-robot systems, MAPF has steadily emerged as a research hotspot. The optimal solution for MAPF is NP-hard. In this paper, we offer a comprehensive analysis of different MAPF solvers. First, we review the cutting-edge solvers of classical MAPF, including optimal, bounded sub-optimal, and unbounded sub-optimal. The performance of some representative classical MAPF solvers is quantitatively compared. In the next part, we summarize the beyond classical MAPF solvers, which try to use the classical MAPF solvers in real-world scenarios. Last, we conclude some challenges that MAPF is experiencing in detail, review recent research on these issues, and make some suggestions for further work.},

  abstract     = {The multi-agent pathfinding problem (MAPF) is the fundamental problem of planning paths for multiple agents, where the key constraint is that the agents will be able to follow these paths concurrently without colliding with each other. Applications of MAPF include automated warehouses, autonomous vehicles, and robotics. Research on MAPF has been flourishing in the past couple of years. Different MAPF research papers assume different sets of assumptions, e.g., whether agents can traverse the same road at the same time, and have different objective functions, e.g., minimize makespan or sum of agents' actions costs. These assumptions and objectives are sometimes implicitly assumed or described informally. This makes it difficult for establishing appropriate baselines for comparison in research papers, as well as making it difficult for practitioners to find the papers relevant to their concrete application. This paper aims to fill this gap and facilitate future research and practitioners by providing a unifying terminology for describing the common MAPF assumptions and objectives. In addition, we also provide pointers to two MAPF benchmarks. In particular, we introduce a new grid-based benchmark for MAPF, and demonstrate experimentally that it poses a challenge to contemporary MAPF algorithms.},

  abstract    = {Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence and robotics, requiring the computation of collision-free paths for multiple agents navigating from their start locations to designated goals. As autonomous systems become increasingly prevalent in warehouses, urban transportation, and other complex environments, MAPF has evolved from a theoretical challenge to a critical enabler of real-world multi-robot coordination. This comprehensive survey bridges the long-standing divide between classical algorithmic approaches and emerging learning-based methods in MAPF research. We present a unified framework that encompasses search-based methods (including Conflict-Based Search, Priority-Based Search, and Large Neighborhood Search), compilation-based approaches (SAT, SMT, CSP, ASP, and MIP formulations), and data-driven techniques (reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and hybrid strategies). Through systematic analysis of experimental practices across 200+ papers, we uncover significant disparities in evaluation methodologies, with classical methods typically tested on larger-scale instances (up to 200 by 200 grids with 1000+ agents) compared to learning-based approaches (predominantly 10-100 agents). We provide a comprehensive taxonomy of evaluation metrics, environment types, and baseline selections, highlighting the need for standardized benchmarking protocols. Finally, we outline promising future directions including mixed-motive MAPF with game-theoretic considerations, language-grounded planning with large language models, and neural solver architectures that combine the rigor of classical methods with the flexibility of deep learning. This survey serves as both a comprehensive reference for researchers and a practical guide for deploying MAPF solutions in increasingly complex real-world applications.},

For road networks, we show that one can compute driving directions in milliseconds or less even at continental scale. A variety of techniques provide different trade-offs between preprocessing effort, space requirements, and query time. Some algorithms can answer queries in a fraction of a microsecond, while others can deal efficiently with real-time traffic. Journey planning on public transportation systems, although conceptually similar, is a significantly harder problem due to its inherent time-dependent and multicriteria nature. Although exact algorithms are fast enough for interactive queries on metropolitan transit systems, dealing with continent-sized instances requires simplifications or heavy preprocessing. The multimodal route planning problem, which seeks journeys combining schedule-based transportation (buses, trains) with unrestricted modes (walking, driving), is even harder, relying on approximate solutions even for metropolitan inputs.},
